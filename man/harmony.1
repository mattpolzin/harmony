.SH DESCRIPTION
Harmony is a small tool that helps teams keep GitHub reviews running
smoothly.
It takes the work out of picking someone from a pool of developers to
review a new PR.
Harmony does this by heuristically determining who on a particular
GitHub Team has the least current/recent review workload.
.PP
Harmony offers a heuristic for PR review requests that is different than
GitHub\(cqs round robin or weighted algorithms, but Harmony can also
work well even if your team uses GitHub\(cqs automatic PR review
requests (see below).
.SS Dependencies
.SS Runtime
Running Harmony requires NodeJS 18+ (and a local installation of
\f[CR]git\f[R]) or alternatively Nix with flakes enabled.
.PP
If you\(cqd like to try Harmony out without even \(lqinstalling\(rq it
and you have Nix installed with flakes enabled, you can run it as
\f[CR]nix run github:mattpolzin/harmony\f[R].
.SS Build time
Building the latest commits of Harmony requires a HEAD build of the
Idris 2 compiler.
Each release page also indicates the version of Idris 2 that particular
release will build against.
.PP
Alternatively, you can build Harmony with Docker (see Docker Build).
.SS Testing
Tests can be run with \f[CR]make test\f[R].
You\(cqll need a few common tools in your \f[CR]PATH\f[R] to run all the
tests: \- \f[CR]realpath\f[R] \- \f[CR]sed\f[R] \- \f[CR]xargs\f[R]
.SS Bash completion
Set up Bash completion by adding the following to your Bash resource
file or profile:
.IP
.EX
eval \(dq$(harmony \-\-bash\-completion\-script)\(dq
.EE
.SS Zsh completion
Zsh completion is supported via \f[CR]bashcompinit\f[R] and can be
loaded by adding the following to your Zsh resource file or profile:
.IP
.EX
eval \(dq$(harmony \-\-zsh\-completion\-script)\(dq
.EE
.SS Initial configuration
For most things harmony does, you need to have a GitHub \c
.UR https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token
Personal Access Token
.UE \c
\&.
.PP
Your Personal Access Token should have the following permissions: \-
\f[CR]repo\f[R] (Full control of private repositories) \-
\f[CR]read:org\f[R] (Read org and team membership, read org projects) \-
\f[CR]read:user\f[R] \- \f[CR]user:email\f[R] \-
\f[CR]read:discussion\f[R] \- \f[CR]read:enterprise\f[R] (Read
enterprise profile data)
.PP
You can either add the PAT to your environment as the
\f[CR]GITHUB_PAT\f[R] (or alternatively \f[CR]GH_TOKEN\f[R]) variable
(perhaps exporting it from your shell resource file or profile) or you
can store your PAT in Harmony\(cqs config file.
The first time you start Harmony, it will ask you to configure your PAT
if you don\(cqt want to use the Environment variable.
You only need one of (a) the ENV var and (b) the config property and the
environment variable will take precedence if you have both set.
.PP
The first time you start Harmony in any particular folder, you will be
asked to provide some information about the GitHub repository you are
working with.
This information is stored in a file named \f[CR]harmony.json\f[R] in
the current working directory.
.PP
Note that the GitHub organization and repository are both slugs, not
names.
These are the values you find in a GitHub URL pointing to your
repository.
Harmony works with personal repositories but some of Harmony\(cqs
features are not available for these repos because they do not have
teams or members.
.IP
.EX
$ harmony sync
Creating a new configuration (storing in harmony.json)...

Harmony uses a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) to communicate with GitHub.
You can set this via the $GITHUB_PAT or $GH_TOKEN environment variables or a config property.
If you don\(aqt set in your config now, you can set later with \(gaharmony config githubPAT abcdefg\(ga.
The ENV var will always take precedence over the config property.

What PAT would you like to set in the config file (ENTER for default: unset)?

What GitHub org would you like to use harmony for (ENTER for default: myorg)?

What repository would you like to use harmony for (ENTER for default: myrepo)?

What GitHub remote repo would you like to use harmony for (ENTER for default: origin)?

Would you like harmony to comment when it requests reviewers? [Y/n] 
Would you like harmony to request team reviews in addition to individuals when it requests reviewers? [Y/n] 
Creating config...
.EE
.SS Usage
Once configured, Harmony supports the following commands that are
documented below: \f[CR]config\f[R], \f[CR]branch\f[R], \f[CR]pr\f[R],
\f[CR]quick\f[R], \f[CR]label\f[R], \f[CR]request\f[R] (also aliased to
\f[CR]rq\f[R]), \f[CR]contribute\f[R], \f[CR]whoami\f[R],
\f[CR]reflect\f[R], \f[CR]list\f[R], \f[CR]graph\f[R],
\f[CR]health\f[R], and \f[CR]sync\f[R].
.PP
\f[B]Note on color output:\f[R] Harmony uses colored output for some
commands.
You can adjust these colors slightly with the \f[CR]theme\f[R]
configuration option.
You can also use the \f[CR]NO_COLOR\f[R] environment variable to disable
all colored output.
Lastly, Harmony will avoid colored output when it determines
\f[CR]stdout\f[R] is not a TTY device (as is the case for
e.g.\ redirecting harmony output into a file or piping into
\f[CR]cat\f[R]: \f[CR]harmony ... | cat\f[R]).
.SH SUBCOMMANDS
.SS \f[CR]branch\f[R]
Print the URI for accessing the currently checked out branch on GitHub.
.PP
Many operating systems have an \f[CR]open\f[R] command (though the name
\(lqopen\(rq is not ubiquitous); this means you can run something like
\f[CR]open $(harmony branch)\f[R] to open a web browser to the current
branch on GitHub.
.SS \f[CR]config {property} [value]\f[R]
Read the given configuration property.
\f[CR]harmony config <property> <value>\f[R] will set the configuration
property.
.PP
Not all configuration properties can be read/set with this command.
.SS Properties
.TP
\f[CR]requestTeams\f[R] (\f[CR]true\f[R]/\f[CR]false\f[R])
When picking a team to review, request review from the whole team, not
just one user on the team.
If you have GitHub configured to pick a member of a team to review when
the team is requested, you probably want to set this to \f[CR]true\f[R]
so harmony tells GitHub the team from which GitHub should then pick an
individual.
.TP
\f[CR]requestUsers\f[R] (\f[CR]true\f[R]/\f[CR]false\f[R])
When requesting a team to review, pick a user from the team to review as
well.
If you have GitHub configured to pick a member of a team to review when
the team is requested, you probably want to set this to \f[CR]false\f[R]
so harmony does not also pick a user.
.TP
\f[CR]commentOnRequest\f[R] (\f[CR]none\f[R]/\f[CR]name\f[R]/\f[CR]at\-mention\f[R])
When requesting a reviewer chosen by Harmony, comment on the pull
request or not.
.TP
\f[CR]branchParsing\f[R] (\f[CR]none\f[R]/\f[CR]jira\f[R]/\f[CR]github\f[R])
Optionally extract a Jira ticket slug or GitHub issue number from the
branch name and prepend it to the PR title or body to link the PR and
ticket/issue.
.TP
\f[CR]defaultRemote\f[R] (optional string)
When pushing new branches, what remote destination should be used.
.TP
\f[CR]mainBranch\f[R] (optional string)
When creating a PR, this is the default base branch.
.TP
\f[CR]theme\f[R] (\f[CR]dark\f[R]/\f[CR]light\f[R])
Use colors suited better for either a dark or light Terminal background.
.TP
\f[CR]githubPAT\f[R] (optional string)
If the \f[CR]$GITHUB_PAT\f[R] and \f[CR]$GH_TOKEN\f[R] environment
variables are not set, this Personal Access Token is used to
authenticate with GitHub.
.SS \f[CR]contribute [options]\f[R]
Print the URI of the oldest non\-draft PR waiting for your review.
If you are not requested for review on any PRs, Harmony will suggest a
PR that your review is not requested on.
.PP
You can skip PRs and retrieve the next\-oldest one by passing a dash
followed by the number to skip (e.g.\ \f[CR]\-2\f[R] to skip the two
oldest waiting PRs).
.PP
You can also more permanently ignore a particular PR (perhaps it has
gone stagnant but your org does not want to close it for whatever
reason).
To do this, use the \f[CR]\-\-ignore\f[R] or \f[CR]\-i\f[R] option and
pass it the GitHub URI or the Pull Request Number of a PR to ignore.
This PR will be omitted from consideration for the \f[CR]contribute\f[R]
command from then on.
This only impacts your local machine where the ignore list is stored in
Harmony\(cqs config file.
.PP
You can simultaneously get the URI for a PR to review and checkout the
branch needing review by passing the \f[CR]\-\-checkout\f[R] or
\f[CR]\-c\f[R] option to the \f[CR]contribute\f[R] command.
.PP
Many operating systems have an \f[CR]open\f[R] command (though the name
\(lqopen\(rq is not ubiquitous); this means you can run something like
\f[CR]open $(harmony contribute)\f[R] to open a web browser to the PR
that Harmony is suggesting.
.PP
You can also run \f[CR]harmony contribute \-\-list\f[R] if you want to
list out a few PRs to consider reviewing them instead of choosing just
one PR to look into and printing that PRs URI.
.SS Examples
Retrieve a URI for the oldest unreviewed and open PR (prioritizing PRs
for which you are a requested reviewer):
.IP
.EX
harmony contribute
.EE
.PP
Retrieve a URI for a PR to contribute a review, skipping over the first
3 suggestions:
.IP
.EX
harmony contribute \-3
.EE
.PP
Retrieve a URI for a PR to contribute a review and check the git branch
out as well:
.IP
.EX
harmony contribute \-\-checkout
.EE
.PP
Permanently ignore a PR by URI:
.IP
.EX
harmony contribute \-\-ignore https://github.com/myorg/myrepo/pull/1234
.EE
.PP
Permanently ignore a PR by its number:
.IP
.EX
harmony contribute \-\-ignore 1234
.EE
.SS \f[CR]graph [\-\-completed] {team\-slug}\f[R]
Graph the relative review workload of each of the members of the given
GitHub Team.
.PP
You can optionally graph completed PR reviews with the
\f[CR]\-\-completed\f[R] flag as well, though these are not considered
for Harmony\(cqs weighting algorithm for review workload.
.SS \f[CR]health\f[R]
Graph all open PRs grouped by the month when each was created.
.PP
The idea is that a healthy repository does not have many old PRs still
open because those PRs represent effort spent by developers that
hasn\(cqt yet paid off.
.SS \f[CR]help [subcommand]\f[R]
Print help.
.SS \f[CR]label {label} [...]\f[R]
Helps you create a PR if one does not exist yet and then it will apply
the given labels to the PR.
This is essentially an alias for the \f[CR]harmony pr\f[R] command but
without support for creating draft PRs.
.PP
Note that labels are \f[I]not\f[R] prefixed with `#' for this command.
There is no need to differentiate labels from other kinds of arguments
to \f[CR]harmony label\f[R].
.SS \f[CR]list [team\-slug]\f[R]
Running \f[CR]harmony list\f[R] will list all the teams for the
configured GitHub organization.
.PP
Running \f[CR]harmony list <team>\f[R] will list the members of the
given GitHub Team.
.SS \f[CR]pr [\-\-draft | \-\-ready] [\-i/\-\-into {<branch\-name>}] [#label, ...]\f[R]
With a branch checked out will reach out to GitHub to determine if there
is an open PR for that branch.
If there is a PR, Harmony will print a URI that can be used to view the
PR.
If there is not a PR, Harmony will help you create one.
New and existing PRs can be marked as drafts by specifying the
\f[CR]\-\-draft\f[R] flag with the \f[CR]pr\f[R] command or they can be
marked as ready for review with the \f[CR]\-\-ready\f[R] flag.
The default behavior for new PRs is to mark them ready.
.PP
If you need to create a PR still, you will be prompted for a branch to
open the PR against (merge into, eventually), a title for the PR, and a
description for the PR.
If you have an \f[CR]EDITOR\f[R] environment variable set, Harmony will
use that editor to get the PR description from you.
If you have a PR template at
\f[CR].github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md\f[R], Harmony will also preload
that into your editor.
If you do not have an \f[CR]EDITOR\f[R] environment variable set, you
will still be able to enter a description from the command line but PR
templates are only supported when an \f[CR]EDITOR\f[R] is specified.
.PP
If you are creating a new PR from a branch that refers to a GitHub issue
(and you have GitHub branch parsing enabled in your harmony config) then
harmony will prepend the issue information onto your new PR description
in a commented out block for you to reference or copy into the PR
description as needed.
.PP
You can specify the branch to merge into via the \f[CR]\-\-into\f[R] CLI
argument if you want to as an alternative to the interactive prompt.
.PP
You can also specify any number of labels to apply by prefixing them
with `#'.
For example, \f[CR]harmony pr #backport #bugfix\f[R] would create a PR
and apply the \f[CR]backport\f[R] and \f[CR]bugfix\f[R] labels.
.PP
If you are using harmony from a script or some other environment without
TTY support, harmony will print a GitHub URL that can be used to create
the PR.
This mode of operation will ignore the \f[CR]\-\-draft\f[R] and
\f[CR]#label\f[R] options.
.PP
Many operating systems have an \f[CR]open\f[R] command (though the name
\(lqopen\(rq is not ubiquitous); this means you can run something like
\f[CR]open $(harmony pr)\f[R] to open a web browser to an existing PR
for the current branch.
.SS Examples
Create a draft pull request for the current branch:
.IP
.EX
harmony pr \-\-draft
.EE
.PP
Create a PR for the current branch and add the \f[CR]urgent\f[R] label:
.IP
.EX
harmony pr #urgent
.EE
.PP
Create a pull request that will merge into the hypothetical
pre\-existing \f[CR]release/2_0\f[R] branch:
.IP
.EX
harmony pr \-\-into release/2_0
.EE
.SS \f[CR]quick [\-\-bugfix] [issue\-title] [...]\f[R]
Helps you create a new GitHub issue and a branch to work on that issue
all in one go.
The branch name will be structured such that if you have GitHub branch
parsing on then the PR you create for the branch later on will refer to
the issue created now.
.PP
By default the branch created will be prefixed with \f[CR]feature\f[R]
but if you specify the \f[CR]\-\-bugfix\f[R] flag then the branch\(cqs
prefix will be \f[CR]bugfix\f[R].
.PP
Any additional arguments other than \f[CR]\-\-bugfix\f[R] will be used
as the issue\(cqs title.
If you don\(cqt specify the title as additional arguments, you will be
prompted for one interactively.
You will also be prompted for an issue description.
.SS \f[CR]reflect\f[R]
Show a summary of your review requests and authored pull requests.
.SS \f[CR]request {team\-slug | +user\-login} [options]\f[R]
Helps you create a PR if one does not exist yet and then it will request
reviews from teams and/or users.
.PP
There is also a \f[CR]harmony rq\f[R] alias for
\f[CR]harmony request\f[R].
.PP
If \f[CR]harmony config requestUsers\f[R] is \f[CR]True\f[R] (defualt)
then harmony will pick someone to review the PR (from one of the listed
teams).
If \f[CR]harmony config requestTeams\f[R] is \f[CR]True\f[R] (default)
then harmony will request reviews from the teams you listed.
If \f[CR]harmony config commentOnRequest\f[R] is \f[CR]True\f[R] then
harmony will comment on the Pull Request indicating that teams & users
were \(lqharmoniously requested\(rq \(en this comment will \(atmention
requested users so it may be useful or annoying depending on the
requested user\(cqs GitHub notification settings.
.PP
You can also require that specific additional users (on top of the one
Harmony will pick for you) are requested to review the PR.
You do this by specifying those users\(cq logins prefixed with `+' as
arguments to Harmony.
This will request review from those specific additional users regardless
of the \f[CR]requestUsers\f[R] setting; that setting controls whether
Harmony picks users from each Team you specify to review PRs.
.PP
You can optionally apply any number of labels to the PR at the same time
as requesting reviewers by prefixing the labels with `#'.
.SS Deferring to GitHub
If your team has GitHub set up to auto\-request reviews from individuals
when a team is requested for review, you probably want to tell harmony
not to also pick someone using its heuristics.
You can run the following \f[CR]config\f[R] commands to tell harmony to
request a team but not also pick an individual from that team:
.IP
.EX
harmony config requestTeams true
harmony config requestUsers false
.EE
.PP
This does not prevent you from requesting specific individuals with the
\f[CR]+<user>\f[R] syntax described above.
.SS Examples
Request review from the most available reviewer from the
\(lqdevelopers\(rq GitHub Team:
.IP
.EX
harmony request developers
.EE
.PP
Request review from the most available reviewer from either the
\(lqfrontend\(rq or \(lqbackend\(rq GitHub Team:
.IP
.EX
harmony request frontend backend
.EE
.PP
Request review from the most available reviewer from the \(lqweb\(rq
team and additionally request review from the users with logins
\(lqcarl001\(rq and \(lqemmaham\(rq:
.IP
.EX
harmony request web +carl001 +emmaham
.EE
.SS \f[CR]sync\f[R]
Sync the locally configured team slugs and user logins that are used by
auto\-completion for Harmony.
This sync is also performed automatically the first time you run Harmony
after more than a day without the configuration being synced.
.SS \f[CR]version\f[R]
Print Harmony\(cqs version.
.SS \f[CR]whoami\f[R]
Print information about the currently configured and authenticated user.
