harmony <subcommand>

Subcommands:
  branch 
      Print the GitHub URI for the currently checked out branch.
  config {<property>} [<value>]
      Get or set the value of a configuration property. Not all properties can
      be set and read via this subcommand.
      properties: requestTeams, requestUsers, commentOnRequest, branchParsing,
                  defaultRemote, mainBranch, theme, githubPAT
  contribute [-c/--checkout | -l/--list] [-<num>] [-i/--ignore {<uri>/<pr-number>}]
      Contribute to an open PR. Prints a URL. Prioritizes PRs you are requested
      to review but will also return other PRs.

      Use dash followed by a number (e.g. '-3') to skip that number of potential
      PRs and return the next.

      Specify a PR to ignore (only affects the local Harmony config on this
      machine) if you would like to more permanently skip a potential PR. Do
      this with the '--ignore' option followed by a GitHub URI or Pull Request
      number.

      Use --list to list multiple PRs instead of just one. This option supports
      skipping PRs but does not support the checkout option because there is no
      single PR that should be checked out.
  graph [-c/--completed] {<team-slug>}
      Graph the relative review workload of the members of the given GitHub
      Team.
  health 
      Graph all open PRs grouped by the month they were created.
  help [<subcommand>]
      Print help
  label {<label>} [...]
      Add one or more labels to a PR, creating a new PR if one does not exist.
      Labels that do not exist yet will be created automatically.
  list [<team-slug>]
      List all teams or the members of the given GitHub Team.
  pr [--ready] [--draft] [-i/--into {<branch-name>}] [#<label>] [...]
      Identify an existing PR or create a new one for the current branch.

      Optionally apply any number of labels by prefixing them with '#'.

      Optionally mark a new or existing PR as a draft with the --draft flag.

      Optionally mark an existing PR as ready for review with the --ready flag.

      Optionally specify the branch to merge into with the --into option.
  quick [--bugfix] [<title>] [...]
      Quickly spin up new work with a GitHub issue and associated feature
      branch. If you have harmony configured to parse GitHub issue numbers
      (harmony config branchParsing github) then any PR created from the new
      branch will automatically link to the new ticket in its description.

      By default the branch will have the 'feature' prefix. If the --bugfix flag
      is specified, the 'bugfix' prefix will be used.

      All additional arguments other than --bugfix will be used as the issue
      title. If you don't give any arguments then you will be prompted to enter
      the issue title interactively. You will also be prompted for the issue
      description.
  reflect 
      Reflect on the current state of ones own PRs and review requests.
  request {<team-slug> | +<user-login>} [#<label>] [...]
      Request review from the given team(s) and one lucky member from one of
      those teams to review the PR for the current branch.

      Also request reviews from any users with logins specified. You specify
      these additional users by prefixing their logins with '+'.

      Optionally apply any number of labels by prefixing them with '#'.
  rq 
      Alias for 'request' command.
  sync 
      Synchronize local config with information from GitHub.
